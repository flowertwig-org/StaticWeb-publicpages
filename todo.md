# How to use/read this document

Nothing in this document should be removed, if something is done and commited it should have a line ~~through it~~ and your nick after it.

All functionality created needs to work on all devices (Read: mobile, tablet, desktop and old browsers).
Think gracefull upgrade :)


# Functionality
- We should support multiple languages. We should only suggest that there are a page for the language in question (Use logic from CMS to decide language). There should be a link for fast and easy switch to that language.
- Goal is to be able to create all public pages needed here in StaticWeb CMS.

# Design
- favicon and logo needs to be created and used (I'm currently thinking of a orange flower or similar but open for suggestions)
- Navigation menu needs trimming to fit all withs and heights.
- probably needs more templates to use (You will know when creating text and content :) )


# Text and Content
- Getting started page should be completed.
- Why use StaticWeb CMS?
- Documentation, simular like jQuery documentation.
	- Controls
		- What controls can be used and how
		- How to create new controls
	- Storage Providers
		- What are a storage provider?
		- What is Storage Provider X?
		- What are the difference between Storage Provider X compared to Storage Provider Y?
- Get involved
- Page not found page should have more examples on it.
- Price plan / Sign up (Talk to Mattias before starting with this)
- Pages and information should be translated to other languages
